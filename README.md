# 2D Simple Rocket Landing Simulation

## Project Overview

Welcome to **EarthReturn**, a project designed to simulate the landing of a rocket in a 2D environment. This project is part of a series that gradually increases in complexity, eventually leading to a full 3D rocket landing simulation. 

This branch focuses on the simplest 2D case where the rocket can move vertically under the influence of gravity and controlled thrust.

## Features

- **2D Rocket Dynamics**: Simulates vertical motion with gravity and thrust.
- **Basic Control**: Implements a simple Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm to guide the rocket to a safe landing.
- **Simulation Environment**: A basic physics simulation that models the rocket's vertical position and velocity.
